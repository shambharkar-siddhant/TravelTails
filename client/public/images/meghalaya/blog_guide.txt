Story - 
Wandering Northeast: From Kharagpur to Shillong
It all started back in my first semester of M.Tech at IIT Kharagpur. My friend (let’s call her Angel Priya) had just wrapped up her internship and was heading home to Guwahati. On a random instinct, I told her, “What if I come drop you?” She smiled — and just like that, the trip began.

We left campus around midnight, caught a 5:30 am flight, and reached Guwahati half-asleep but excited. I found a cheap backpackers’ hostel near her place — Gibbon Backpackers — just ₹400 a night. Best decision ever. The vibe? Unreal.

I met travelers with wild stories —
One left home searching for freedom.
Another was doing a PhD on mountain tribes.
One was an IITG student just looking to connect.

I spent hours chatting with strangers, each conversation opening new worlds.

Later that day, I wandered through Guwahati on my own. Talked to locals, tried street food, visited a mall — and unexpectedly, it felt like walking through a slice of Japan or Korea. The lifestyle there is heavily East Asian–inspired — minimal, aesthetic, peaceful.

The Meghalaya Escape
Next day, we headed to Meghalaya — me, Angel Priya, and her two friends. A 3-hour bus ride took us to Shillong, where we grabbed a tourist taxi (₹3.5k for the two days). First stop? NohKaLikai Falls.

It's hard to explain the view —
A waterfall spilling through clouds,
Falling from the sky like a secret.

We stood still, not saying much. Just breathing it all in.

Then came Umiam Lake Park — quiet, scenic, touristy. We sat by the lake and devoured authentic momos. Real stuff. Not the fake ones you get in cities.

Later, we visited Lady Hydari Park — a blend of zoo and garden. Saw a flamingo for the first time (those eyes are wild), clicked pictures near small waterfalls, and soaked in the calm.

Evening rolled in and we checked into a cozy cottage. After freshening up, we stepped out again — this time to explore Police Bazar at night.

And that’s when the magic happened.

Midnight in Shillong
Around 10 p.m., me and Priya were still walking in Police Bazar.
No noise. No crowd. Just the two of us under yellow streetlights.
The air was cold, but the vibe — warm.

It felt like a scene out of a peaceful indie movie.
Sometimes, the best moments are unplanned.

We tried quirky street food -
Jadoh, a traditional Khasi dish of rice cooked with pork and local spices, was a revelation. The flavors were deep and comforting, embodying the essence of Meghalaya's culinary heritage.

We couldn't resist the smoked pork, its rich aroma and tender texture offering a smoky delight that lingered on the palate. 

The Dohneiiong, pork cooked with black sesame seeds, presented a unique blend of nuttiness and spice, showcasing the region's diverse flavors.

The Pukhlein, a sweet rice cake, provided a perfect end to our street food journey. Its subtle sweetness and soft texture were a gentle contrast to the bold flavors we'd experienced earlier.

and still had space for dinner, so we went to Barbeque Chinese Restaurant. Every dish was a hit. No misses. We came back, played card games, and called it a night.

Caves, Forests & Biryani
The following morning, our taxi awaited, ready to transport us into the heart of nature. Our destination: Balpakram National Park, often referred to as the "Land of Perpetual Winds" by the local Garo people. As we ventured into this untouched wilderness, the landscape unfolded into a tapestry of deep gorges, dense forests, and dramatic cliffs.

Trekking through the park, we were enveloped by the symphony of chirping birds and rustling leaves. The air was crisp, carrying with it tales of ancient legends whispered by the winds. We paused at a vantage point, gazing upon the vast expanse that stretched into the horizon, feeling both humbled and invigorated by nature's grandeur.

By evening, we were back in Guwahati. Last stop? Mughal Garden Biryani — the perfect goodbye meal.

And That’s a Wrap… For Now
It wasn’t a luxury trip. Nothing was planned perfectly. But it had soul — good people, good food, and places that make you pause.

Still many corners of the Northeast left to explore — and I know I’ll be back.

Until then, this one stays in the top shelf of my memory drawer.
